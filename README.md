a. What was the most challenging part for you?
The most challenging part was creating a responsive navigation that transitions smoothly between desktop and mobile views while maintaining accessibility.

b. How did you solve it?
I researched mobile-first navigation patterns on CSS-Tricks and implemented a hamburger menu for mobile that transforms into a horizontal nav on desktop. I used JavaScript to toggle aria-expanded attributes for accessibility.

c. What did you learn during this task?
I deepened my understanding of CSS Grid for layout structuring and learned about the importance of proper contrast ratios for accessibility in my color choices.

d. If we ask you to improve it tomorrow, what would you add?
I would add:

Smooth scroll behavior between sections

Loading animations for better perceived performance

Form validation with user-friendly error messages

A testimonials section for social proof

e. What is your goal for the next 3 months if selected?
My goal is to master React.js and build 3 substantial projects that demonstrate state management, API integration, and component architecture. I also plan to improve my UI/UX design skills through courses and practice.
